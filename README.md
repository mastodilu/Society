# Society

Make the society grow and evolve.

## What I learnt

- C language
- inter-process communication
- threads handling

### Description

This is a project that I made at school where an initial set of processes (A and B) is initialized with their own names and genomes.
Each person may choose the right partner to make children and evolve the initial population.

### Run the project

1. `make`
2. `./gestore`
